# Discord Pokémon Bot
This is a small discord bot example. which sends a random first gen. pokemon.
## References
My code is based on [this nice guide](https://www.devdungeon.com/content/javascript-discord-bot-tutorial)
to discord/node.js development.

Also i used [this api](https://pokeapi.co/) to get the pokémon data.
